### Code Red: Menstrual Health Meets Innovation

Yesterday, TIDI Volunteers brought the conversation on menstrual health to the *Kwara State Special Needs School* through our impactful session: **CODE RED: Menstrual Health Meets Innovation.**

The team of 3 volunteers successfully lectured 42 deaf primary 6 girls on:

- Menstrual hygiene best practices  
- DIY pad alternatives  
- How tech apps can help track menstrual cycles

This initiative aims to empower young deaf girls with knowledge, confidence, and innovation in menstrual health.

### Empowering the Deaf Through Technology Training

The *Tech Inclusion for the Deaf Initiative (TIDI)* recently hosted a **two-week training bootcamp** focused on introducing deaf youths to **basic digital literacy and assistive technologies**.

Participants learned how to:

- Use accessibility tools on smartphones  
- Communicate online using sign-language video calls  
- Explore employment opportunities in tech

We believe *accessibility is a right, not a privilege* — and through continuous empowerment, the deaf community can thrive in a digital world.
